# Software Development Security

Security, as part of the software development process, is an ongoing process involving people and practices, and ensures application confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Secure software is the result of security aware software development processes where security is built in and thus software is developed with security in mind.

Security is most effective if planned and managed throughout every stage of [[sdlc]], especially in critical applications or those that process sensitive information.

The solution to software development security is more than just the technology. [[dependency-management]] also plays a big role since software are usually built on top of other softwares.
