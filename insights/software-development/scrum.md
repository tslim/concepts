# Scrum

[Scrum](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>) is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called **sprints**, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called **daily scrums**. At the end of the sprint, the team holds **sprint review**, to demonstrate the work done, and **sprint retrospective** to continuously improve.
