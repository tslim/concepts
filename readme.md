## Caveats

- This is by no means an exhaustive list of concepts. I'm sure I've missed many more and do suggest them if you can.
- Links between notes are based on my understanding. It might not be accurate or relevant.
- Bias towards any tools/concepts are solely based on my experience or lack of it with other alternatives.
