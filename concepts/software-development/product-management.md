# Product Management (Software)

[Software product management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_product_management) (sometimes also referred to as digital product management or, in the right context just product management) is the discipline of building, implementing and managing software or digital products, taking into account life-cycle considerations and an audience. It is the discipline and business process which governs a product from its inception to the market or customer delivery and service in order to maximize revenue.[1] This is in contrast to software that is delivered in an ad hoc manner, typically to a limited clientele, e.g. service.

Related closely to [[scrum]] and [[kanban]] as Product Teams may adopt those methodology to develop and manage the software development.
