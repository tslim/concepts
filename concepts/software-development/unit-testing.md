# Unit Testing

[Unit Testing](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/) is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output.

To test how different parts of the system work together, use [[integration-testing]].
