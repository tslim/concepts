# Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build [[automation]] tools, and a debugger ([[debugging]]). Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion.
