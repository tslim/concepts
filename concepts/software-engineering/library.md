# Library

A software library generally consists of pre-written code, classes, procedures, scripts, configuration data and more. Typically, a developer might manually add a software library to a program to achieve more functionality or to automate a process without writing code for it.

For example, when developing a mathematical program or application, a developer may add a mathematics software library to the program to eliminate the need for writing complex functions. All of the available functions within a software library can just be called/used within the program body without defining them explicitly. Similarly, a compiler might automatically add a related software library to a program on run time.

A lot of languages have their own [[dependency-management]] system to assist in installing these libraries.
