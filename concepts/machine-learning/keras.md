# Keras

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is an open-source neural-network [[library]] written in Python. It is capable of running on top of [[tensor-flow]], Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, [[r-programming-language]], Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep [[artificial-neural-networks]], it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.
