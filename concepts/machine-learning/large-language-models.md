# Large Language Models (LLM)

A recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI) is the introduction of language processing technologies that enable us to build more intelligent systems with a richer understanding of language than ever before. Large pre-trained Transformer ([[generative-pretrained-transformer]]) language models, or simply large language models, vastly extend the capabilities of what systems are able to do with text.
