# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-augmented generation is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with information fetched from specific and relevant data sources.

In other words, it fills a gap in how [[large-language-models]] work. Under the hood, LLMs are neural networks, typically measured by how many parameters they contain. An LLMâ€™s parameters essentially represent the general patterns of how humans use words to form sentences.
