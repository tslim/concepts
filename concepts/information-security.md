# Information Security (Infosec)

Information Security refers to the processes and methodologies which are designed and implemented to protect print, electronic, or any other form of confidential, private and sensitive information or data from unauthorized access, use, misuse, disclosure, destruction, modification, or disruption.

The fundamental principles (tenets) of information security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Every element of an information security program (and every security control put in place by an entity) should be designed to achieve one or more of these principles.
