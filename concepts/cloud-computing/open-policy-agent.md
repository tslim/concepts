# Open Policy Agent

The [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA, pronounced “oh-pa”) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language ([[declarative-programming]]) that let's you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software.
