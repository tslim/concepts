# Domain Name Service (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like `nytimes.com` or `espn.com`. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
