# Vault

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a tool for securely accessing secrets ([[secrets-management]]). A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as [[api]] keys, passwords, or certificates. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: [[database]] credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.
