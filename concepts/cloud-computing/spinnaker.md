# Spinnaker

[Spinnaker](http://www.spinnaker.io/) is an open-source [[continuous-delivery]] platform for releasing software changes with high [[velocity]] and confidence. Through a powerful [[abstraction]] layer, Spinnaker provides compelling tooling that empowers developers to own their application code from commit to delivery. As the most mature and widely productionalized continuous delivery platform, Spinnaker can apply the expertise of Netflix, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to your [[sdlc]]. User companies include Target, Salesforce, Airbnb, Cerner, Adobe, and JPMorgan Chase.

Helps facilitate [[git-ops]], and grant developers control of provisioning infrastructure for apps. Use Spinnaker’s Clouddriver to deploy to all of the major public cloud providers and [[kubernetes]]. You may even orchestrate configuration and firmware changes as part of Spinnaker delivery pipelines.
