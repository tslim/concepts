# Serverless Computing

Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers.

You can think of serverless computing as an [[abstraction]] over the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on the code.

## Examples

- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
