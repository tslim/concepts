# C4 Model

The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) is an "[[abstraction]]-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how software architects and developers think about and build software. The small set of abstractions and diagram types makes the C4 model easy to learn and use.
