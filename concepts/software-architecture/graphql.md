# GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for your [[api]], and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

GraphQL follows the same set of constraints as [[rest]] APIs, but it organizes data into a graph using one interface. Objects are represented by nodes (defined using the GraphQL schema), and the relationship between nodes is represented by edges in the graph.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[api]: ../software-engineering/api "Application Programming Interface (API)"
[rest]: rest "Representational State Transfer"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
