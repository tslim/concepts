# Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) is a term used to describe security testing that is designed to identify and help address cyber security [[vulnerability]]. The meaning of VAPT can vary from one geographical region to another, either as a bracket for multiple distinct services, or a single, combined offering. VAPT as a whole could include anything from automated vulnerability assessments to human-led [[penetration-test]] and red team operations.
