# Data Loss Prevention

Data loss prevention (DLP) -- sometimes referred to as data leak prevention, information loss prevention and extrusion prevention -- is a strategy to mitigate threats to critical data. DLP is commonly implemented as part of an organization's plan for overall data security.

Using a variety of software tools and data privacy practices, DLP aims to prevent unauthorized access / [[breach]] to sensitive information. It does this by classifying the different content types within a data object and applying automated protection policies.
