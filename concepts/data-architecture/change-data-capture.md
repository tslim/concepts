# Change Data Capture

Change data capture refers to the process or technology for identifying and capturing changes made to a [[database]]. Those changes can then be applied to another data repository or made available in a format consumable by [[etl]], EAI, or other types of data integration tools. ([[data-fabric]])

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[database]: database "Database"
[etl]: etl "Extract, transform, load"
