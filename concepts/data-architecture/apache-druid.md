# Apache Druid

[Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/) is a high performance real-time [[data-analytics]] [[database]]. It’s designed for workflows where fast queries and ingest really matter. Druid excels at instant data visibility, ad-hoc queries, operational analytics, and handling high concurrency.

You can stream data from [[apache-kafka]] using [Druid's Kafka indexing service](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-kafka.html).
