# DataOps

DataOps is an automated, process-oriented methodology, used by analytic and data teams, to improve the quality and reduce the cycle time of [[data-analytics]]. While DataOps began as a set of best practices, it has now matured to become a new and independent approach to data analytics. DataOps applies to the entire data lifecycle from data preparation to reporting, and recognizes the interconnected nature of the data analytics team and information technology operations.

DataOps incorporates the [[agile]] methodology to shorten the cycle time of analytics development in alignment with business goals. [2]

[[devops]] focuses on continuous delivery by leveraging on-demand IT resources and by automating test and deployment of analytics. This merging of software development and IT operations has improved velocity, quality, predictability and scale of software engineering and deployment. Borrowing methods from DevOps, DataOps seeks to bring these same improvements to data analytics.
