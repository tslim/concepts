# Apache Spark

Apache Spark is a powerful unified analytics engine for large-scale distributed data processing and machine learning. On top of the Spark core data processing engine are [[library]] for SQL, machine learning, graph computation, and stream processing. These libraries can be used together in many stages in modern data pipelines and allow for code reuse across [[batch-processing]], interactive, and [[streaming-processing]] applications. Spark is useful for [[etl]] processing, [[data-analytics]] and machine learning workloads, and for batch and interactive processing of SQL queries, machines learning inferences, and artificial intelligence applications.
